# React Native: Obscure Third-Party Library Compatibility Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose bug in React Native applications involving third-party library compatibility issues. The problem involves unclear error messages that don't immediately point to the root cause, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description

The primary issue showcased is an unexpected behavior or error arising from using a third-party library.  The specific error might vary depending on the library and its incompatibility with the React Native version, or a conflict with other libraries.  The error messages are often vague and require extensive debugging to pinpoint the source.

## Solution

The solution focuses on identifying the conflict, analyzing library dependencies, and either resolving the conflict or finding a compatible alternative library. Thorough testing and version management are crucial in preventing similar issues.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project_directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Run the application: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
