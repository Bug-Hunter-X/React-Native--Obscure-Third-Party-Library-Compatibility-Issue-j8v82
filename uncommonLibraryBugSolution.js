The solution involves carefully reviewing the documentation of the third-party library and ensuring compatibility with the React Native version used.  If there is a version mismatch, updating the library or React Native might resolve the issue.

Also, check for dependency conflicts; using a dependency management tool (such as `npm ls` or `yarn why`) can reveal conflicting package versions.  Consider using a more stable, well-maintained library.  As a last resort,  you could attempt to modify the library source code directly (only recommended if you're very familiar with the library's internals and have no other option). 

Example (Illustrative):

```javascript
//uncommonLibraryBugSolution.js
//Instead of using the problematic library...
//import ProblematicLibrary from 'problematic-library';

// ...use a more compatible or updated version, or alternative
import CompatibleLibrary from 'compatible-library';

//Then use CompatibleLibrary in the relevant components
```
